# TANKEF
FEM modeling deformation of a Tank Filled with fluid.

TANKEF v1.0

This code can be used to model the deformation and internal stress of a tank filled with a fluid. There are 2 version a “Bench Mark” one that was used to verify the results and the user’s version.

The FEM mesh is generated by distmesh.m a code by Persson (2018). 

The math behind the FEM for radial structures can be seen on Chandrupatla and Belegundu’s book. 

The code can consider the force on the walls or/and the force due to the weight of the water, see lines 177 to 196. 

The codes is very well commented. Check the lines and run the example before changing anything.
